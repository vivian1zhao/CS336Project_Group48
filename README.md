## Description

In this project, we designed and implemented a relational database–driven web application for online train booking and administration. We used HTML and JSP for the user interface, MySQL (hosted on AWS RDS) for the database, and Java, JavaScript, and JDBC to connect the UI to the database, deploying the application on a Tomcat server via AWS EC2.


## System Components
- **Account Management**: Registration, login/logout for customers, admins, and customer reps

- **Schedule Search & Browsing**: Search trains by origin/destination/date, view stops and fares, sort results
- **Booking & Reservation**: Create/cancel one‑way or round‑trip bookings, apply child/senior/disabled discounts, view current and past reservations
- **Discount & Fare Engine**: Automatically calculate and apply eligible fare reductions
- **Administrator Dashboard**: Pre‑established admin account, manage customer‑rep accounts, generate monthly sales reports, list reservations and revenue by line or customer, identify top customers and busiest lines
- **Customer‑Rep Interface**: CRUD train schedules, handle customer questions (browse, search, reply), list customers with reservations on a given line/date
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Sales and revenue statistics, insights on best customers and top train lines
- **Customer Q&A Module:**: Forum for end‑users to submit questions and view answers from customer reps
